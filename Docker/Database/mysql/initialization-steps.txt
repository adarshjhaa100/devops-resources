* run container with volume mysql-vol for persistence:
Here, we have exposed the port 3306 of container through 3306 of host. 


docker run \
--volume mysql-vol:/var/lib/mysql \
--name=mysql-sample \
-p 3306:3306 \
-d mysql-server-docker:latest



* run bash inside the container

docker exec -i -t mysql-sample /bin/bash



* setup user:

bash#: mysql -p
password: enter the password used while creating dockerfile


* create user and grant privileges:

create user 'dockerUser' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'dockerUser' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

ALTER USER 'dockerUser' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';


* now we can connect to the user 'dockerUser' with password 'password';
Note: this is just for initial setup, some of the steps can be skipped
